# What's Next?

This is my first first Rails application that i built following the getting started tutorial.

Now i am going to add the recommend features and deploy updates to continue learning. Here are some of the ideas given by the tutorial:

- [x] Improve the design with CSS ([Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/))

- [x] Add product reviews

- [] Add wishlists for users to save products

- [] Add a checkout flow for payments

- [] Finish translating the app into another language

- [] Add a carousel for product images

And also use the recommend learning materials from the Ruby on Rails Guides:

- [Active Record Basics](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)

- [Layouts and Rendering in Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html)

- [Testing Rails Applications](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html)

- [Debugging Rails Applications](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html)

- [Securing Rails Applications](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html)

Thanks for checking out!
