# What's Next?

This is my first first Rails application that i built following the getting started tutorial.

Now i am going to add the recommend features and deploy updates to continue learning. Here are some of the ideas given by the tutorial:

- Improve the design with CSS
- Add product reviews
- Finish translating the app into another language
- Add a checkout flow for payments
- Add wishlists for users to save products
- Add a carousel for product images

And also use the recommend learning materials from the Ruby on Rails Guides:

- Active Record Basics
- Layouts and Rendering in Rails
- Testing Rails Applications
- Debugging Rails Applications
- Securing Rails Applications

Thanks for checking out!
